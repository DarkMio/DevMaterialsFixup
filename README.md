Dota 2 Materials Fixup for Hammer
=====

Hammer doesn't understand $SOLIDCOLOR with the given Syntax.
The idea behind is simple:

Change the material-files locally on your Hammer SDK in order to make'em work.
Since the material-files only get referenced with a name, they still continue to load fine in Dota2 without any problem.

Usage:
Download the zip.
Overwrite the materials in /Alien Swarm/swarm/materials/dev/ OR /Alien Swarm/swarm/addons/Dota2Extract/materials/dev

Have fun!
